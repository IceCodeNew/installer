huge thanks to everyone who helped make this release happen! :tada: \r\n\r\n_A quick note to any packagers. The generated shell completions and man page are\r\nnow in the `gen` directory of the repo. They're also included in the pre-built\r\nrelease artifacts on the releases page._\r\n\r\n### Improvements\r\n\r\n- #115 Do not replace symlink with output file (@SimplyDanny)\r\n  - Fixes an issue where a symlink would be replaced with a regular file\r\n- #124 Fix tests (@Linus789)\r\n  - Removed displaying the file path when passing the `--preview` flag and fixed\r\n    how text coloring was handled in tests\r\n\r\n### Breaking\r\n\r\n- #192 Rename `--string-mode` to `--fixed-strings` (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Renamed `-s` `--string-mode` to `-f` `--fixed-strings` to better match\r\n    similar tools\r\n  - `-s` and `--string-mode` will still continue to work for backwards\r\n    compatibility, but are no longer documented\r\n- #258 Error on `$<num><non_num>` capture replacement names (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Previously when you tried to use a numbered capture group right before some\r\n    letters in the replacement text (e.g. `$1foo`) then it would be considered\r\n    the impossible-to-use `1foo` capture. The correct way to pass the numbered\r\n    capture group in this case would be to surround the number with curly braces\r\n    like so `${1}foo`. The error just detects this case and informs the user of\r\n    the issue\r\n\r\n### Docs\r\n\r\n- #93 Add note about in-place file modification to --help output (@jchook)\r\n- #148 Doc: nitpick `--` has no special meaning to shells (@hexagonrecursion)\r\n- #181 Fix man page -f flag help text (@ulope)\r\n  - Fixed copy-pasted text in the man page's `-f` flag's help text\r\n- #186 Improve error message for failed replacements (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #187 Freshen up README (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Added a repology badge to document different installation methods\r\n  - Improved the formatting of the benchmarks\r\n- #207 Documenting `$` escape (@yahkbar)\r\n  - Adds a section in the README that covers that `$$` is a literal `$` in the\r\n    replacement text\r\n- #227 Improve README readability (@vassudanagunta)\r\n  - Various formatting improvements\r\n- #231 Use `clap_mangen` and `roff` to generate manpage (@nc7s)\r\n  - This change ensures the man page contents stay in sync with the CLI\r\n    automatically, and fixes some broken rendering of the existing manpage\r\n- #243 Exclude unsupported packages from the repology badge (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n\r\n### Pre-built Releases\r\n\r\n- (11295fb) Add ARM target (@chmln)\r\n  - Added the `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` target to CI and releases\r\n- #114 Adding `aarch64-apple-darwin` target (@yahkbar)\r\n- #143  Fix paths to release binary in \"publish\" action (@skrattaren)\r\n- #179 Build Adjustments (@yahkbar)\r\n  - `strip`ed release binaries and added the `aarch64-ubuntu-linux-musl` target\r\n- #204 Adding `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` target (@yahkbar)\r\n  - Added the `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` target to the list of targets to\r\n    build in CI and for each release\r\n- #205 Resolving broken `aarch64-apple-darwin` tests (@yahkbar)\r\n  - Switched `aarch64-apple-darwin` to only try building the executable without\r\n    running the tests since there seems to be no easy way to test for ARM Apple\r\n    targets\r\n- #206 Adding Windows builds back (@yahkbar)\r\n  - Added the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and `x86_64-windows-musl` targets back to\r\n    the list of targets to build in CI and for each release\r\n\r\n### Internal\r\n\r\n- #118 Fix master (@SimplyDanny)\r\n  - Fixes several cross-compilation issues that effected different targets in CI\r\n- #182 `cargo update` (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Bumps dependencies to their latest compatible versions\r\n- #183 Switch `memmap` -> `memmap2` (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Switches away from an unmaintained crate\r\n- #184 Add editor config file matching rustfmt config (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Adds an `.editorconfig` file matching the settings listed in the\r\n    `.rustfmt.toml` file\r\n- #185 Fix warnings and clippy lints (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #188 Switch `atty` for `is-terminal` (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Switches away from an unmaintained crate\r\n- #189 Replace structopt with clap v4 (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Switches away from a defacto deprecated crate\r\n- #190 Change how all shell variants are expressed (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Tiny tidying up PR\r\n- #196 Move generating static assets to a `cargo-xtask` task (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Moves the generation of the man page and shell completions from a build\r\n    script to a [`cargo-xtask`](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask) task\r\n- #197 Add a release checklist (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #209 Dependency updates (@yahkbar)\r\n- #235 Update generated assets (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #236 Tone down dependabot (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #245 Update sd to 2021 edition (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Updates `sd` to the Rust 2021 edition\r\n- #248 Misc Cargo.toml tweaks (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Switches to use workspace edition and dependencies where appropriate\r\n- #249 Resolve CI warnings (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n  - Switched from `actions-rs` actions to `dtolnay@rust-toolchain`\r\n  - Switched from using `::set-output` to `$GITHUB_ENV`\r\n- #251 Update dependencies (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- A lot of sad CI tweaking:\r\n    - #252 Fix build target usage in CI (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n    - #253 Improve publishing CI job (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n    - #256 More CI tweaks (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n    - #257 Fix publish action (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #267 Rework the replacements flag (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #269 Make modified text blue instead of green (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #271 Fix release checklist indentation (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #272 Remove outdated release checklist step (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #274 Prepare 1.0.0-beta.0 release (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n- #275 Update `sd` version in lockfile (@CosmicHorrorDev)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chmln/sd/releases/128455980/reactions","total_count":48,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":22,"confused":0,"heart":14,"rocket":11,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":10}
